I have a dream today!I have a dream that one day every
valley shall be exalted, and every hill and mountain shall
be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the
crooked places will be made straight; "and the glory of the
Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together."
This is our hope, and this is the faith that I go back to the
South with.With this faith, we will be able to hew out of the
mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith, we will
be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into
a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith, we will
be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle
together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom
together, knowing that we will be free one day.
